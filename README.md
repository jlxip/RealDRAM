# RealDRAM
An architecture with non-refreshed DRAM.

## What?
RealDRAM is a really simple esoteric architecture in which memory is lost after a few cycles (defined at `MEMORY_LOSS`, top of the file, default is 128), so it needs to be refreshed manually. This repository contains a virtual machine for it, made in C++.

RealDRAM has 8-bit words and 16-bit addresses (64K of memory). It should be Turing-complete (not proven), even though it has only "two" instructions. These instructions are BRANCH (conditional branch) and NAND. The RealDRAM VM executes raw binaries with data and instructions in them. The binary is loaded at `0x0000`, which is the entry point. The first byte of an instruction is the opcode, and the rest are Little-Endian addresses.

The architecture has no registers, but there is a flag which is updated on NAND operations.

### Opcodes üñ•Ô∏è
The first bit of the opcode (starting from the left) indicates whether it's a **BRANCH** (`0`) or **NAND** (`1`).

#### BRANCH üê∏
The branch instruction is a conditional branch, which will only fire if the flag is up.

The second bit of the opcode says whether the branch is **direct** (`0`) or **indirect** (`1`). The next two bytes have the address.

In direct branches, the jump is quite straightforward. Indirect branches will read two bytes starting from that address and then jump to the address stored there. Remember: Little-Endian.

#### NAND üî£
NAND opcodes have 5 extra bits of information:
* **Bit** (`0`) or **byte** (`1`). Whether this NAND affects a single bit or the whole byte pointed by the address.
* **Other** (`0`) or **itself** (`1`). If this NAND's origin is the same as the destination. That is, NANDing to itself.
* **HI**, **MID**, and **LO**. Three bits used in bit NANDs, they indicate the bit to touch, so `010` = third bit STARTING FROM THE RIGHT. In byte NANDs they are not checked, so (hint) they can be used to store whatever you want.

The next two bytes contain the address of the origin, and if the NAND is not to itself, the following two have the destination.

NAND is the only instruction that updates the flag, which is set to the result of the operation in bit NANDs. In byte NANDs, the OR of all the resulting bits is performed.

For example, `101010000000000000000000`. Its bytes would be `10101000 11111111 00000000`, the opcode indicates `NAND-BIT-ITSELF-2`, and the address is `0x00FF`. So, if that address contains `0x00`, the result would be `0x04`. The flag would be `1`, as `NAND(0, 0)=1`.

### Memory loss
Byte NANDs cost 8 cycles. Any other instruction costs 1 cycle.

When a byte is written for the first time, it starts rotting. Bytes that are not touched in runtime (such as the binary when loaded) do not suffer from the loss, neither read bytes do, so the origin of a NAND-OTHER does not necessarily rot.

To refresh a bit, the naive approach could be to NAND it twice. Better than that, one could NAND it with an origin which is known to be `1`.

### Memory mapped I/O
The VM supports simple I/O.
Byte at `0xFFFF` is a buffer for console interaction. It will rot when written by the program. It will not rot when written by the VM. Writing to `0xFFFD` will trigger a read from stdin and put the byte in the buffer. Writing to `0xFFFE` will trigger a write to stdout.

Bytes at `0xFFFD` and `0xFFFE` are always zero, even after you write to them, so they can be used as a fixed address to get a zero byte. If the binary is large enough to be 64KB long, they will not be zero, but whatever the binary specifies, but they still won't be changed.

Jumping to `0xFFFF` will terminate the program.

See [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/badcode/comments/hstq8j/found_this_answer_on_stackoverflow_pretty_sure/fyfndqi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

## Extra
An example program, `echo`, can be found in the `examples` directory. Compile it with `asm.py echo`, which will generate `echo.bin`.

## What's next?
There may be bugs! This was programmed really fast, so probably there's a bug hidden somewhere. If you find one, please open a pull request :)

I propose the following ideas to the community, in case someone wants to waste their time with this:
- [ ] Prove the architecture is Turing-complete.
- [ ] A program that adds two numbers from input.
- [ ] An assembler for RealDRAM.
- [ ] A high level language. Creating a compiler that makes sure no necessary memory is lost would be quite challenging.

If you do one of these projects or a cool program for RealDRAM, open an issue and I will link your repo here :D
